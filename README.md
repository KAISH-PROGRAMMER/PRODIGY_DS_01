Visualizing Distribution of a Variable: Bar Chart vs. Histogram
Bar Chart
A bar chart is a graphical representation of categorical data with rectangular bars. Each bar represents a category, and the height (or length) of the bar corresponds to the value or frequency of that category. Bar charts are used to compare different categories.
When to Use a Bar Chart:
Comparing the frequency of different categories.
Visualizing categorical data, such as gender, types of products, or regions.
When the categories are discrete and non-continuous.
Example:
Visualizing the distribution of gender in a population.
Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of continuous numerical data. It is similar to a bar chart, but instead of comparing categories, it divides the data into intervals (bins) and shows the frequency of data points in each interval.
When to Use a Histogram:
Visualizing the distribution of continuous data, such as ages, heights, or weights.
Understanding the shape of the data distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, bimodal).
When the data is continuous and can be grouped into intervals.
Example:
Visualizing the distribution of ages in a population.
